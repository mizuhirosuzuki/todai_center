\begin{frame}\frametitle{Research Question \& Roadmap}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Research Question: Does cold weather on the exam date worsen performance in a high-stakes exam?
    \item Roadmap:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Background
        \item Data
        \item Empirical strategy
        \item Results
        \item (Some more results not in the paper for now)
      \end{itemize}
    \item A quick heads-up\dots
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Planning to submit the paper to JEEM short 
        \item Max 3,000 words (but ``modestly longer papers will be considered'')
        \item My paper now has 3,200 words
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Background - Center Test}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In Japan, for public university admission, students need to take two exams:
    \item First-stage: \textcolor{red}{Center Test}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Held in mid-January (Saturday and Sunday)
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Social science, Japanese, and English on the first day (9:30 AM - 6:10 PM)
            \item Mathematics and natural science on the second day (9:30 AM - 5:50 PM)
          \end{itemize}
        \item Questions are multiple-choice and common for all exam takers
        \item Students take the exam in their own prefectures
      \end{itemize}
    \item Second-stage: University-specific exams
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Universities hold exams typically in \textcolor{red}{late February} and/or mid-March
        \item Students take the exams at universities they apply for
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Background - Admission for the University of Tokyo}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The University of Tokyo (UTokyo) is the most prestigious university in Japan
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Highest-ranked univ. in Japan (73rd ranked in the world ranking) (U.S. News) \\
          (The second highest-ranked univ. is Kyoto University, 125th ranked in the world ranking)
        \item Kawaguchi and Ma (2008): ``The University of Tokyo has occupied the top position of the single-peaked university hierarchy since its establishment in 1877.''
      \end{itemize}
    \item Center Test scores for admission to UTokyo:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Used for eligibility to take the second-stage exam
          %Thresholds varying across years and majors are set, and if scores at Center Test are below the thresholds, the students cannot take the second-stage exam.
        \item Taken into consideration for final admission 
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The final score of a student is the weighted sum of exam scores at the first- (20\%) and second-stage (80\%) exams
          \end{itemize}

    \item Weather information from Japan Meteorological Agency
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Hourly information on temperature, rainfall, snowfall, snow on the ground
        \item I use average between 6 AM to 6 PM
      \end{itemize}
    \item Matriculation for UTokyo from University Basic Information
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Information from 2012 to 2020 on the number of matriculated students for each university by prefectures at which their high schools are located
          \begin{itemize}
            \item By gender (male vs. female)
            \item By major (humanity vs. science)
          \end{itemize}
        \item I calculate the matriculation shares for UTokyo from a prefecture $j$ in year $t$ as 
          \begin{equation*}
            \frac{\text{\# matriculations for UTokyo from $j$ in year $t$}}{\text{\# total matriculations for UTokyo in year $t$}}

          Notes:
          Matriculation share (\%) is the share of newly matriculated students to the University of Tokyo from each prefecture.
          The matriculation share is calculated based on the ratio of the number of students from high schools in the prefecture to the total number of matriculation.
          I use weather variables at prefecture capitals between 6 AM and 6 PM on days of Center Test.

        Average of the shares across years is shown in the map.
        Although not shown in the legend due to the lack of the space, the lightest color in the map means the matriculation share between 0 to 0.5\%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Empirical Strategy - Why UTokyo?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose that low temperature negatively affects exam performance
    \item If I consider a matriculation for a middle-ranked university,
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item students in the prefecture who would have gotten into the middle-ranked university if the temperature were higher may end up in a lower-ranked university instead, but
        \item students in the prefecture who would have gotten into a higher-ranked university may end up in the middle-ranked university instead
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Considering matriculation for UTokyo (the most prestigious university in Japan) rules out the second possibility

  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Weather on the exam dates affects the matriculations for UTokyo
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A decrease in temperature from 3-6 \degree C to $<$0 \degree C decreases the probability of matriculation by 0.18 percentage points \\
          (9\% of the average and 22\% of the median matriculation shares)
        \item Snow on the ground cumulated more than 10cm decreases the probability of matriculation by 0.11 percentage points \\
          (5\% of the average and 13\% of the median matriculation shares)
      \end{itemize}
    \item Suggests that exam performance is negatively affected by winter weather
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Low temperature in the morning or during the exam negatively affects cognitive ability?
        \item Snow on the ground makes feet wet, which further decreases body temperature?
        \item Cumulated snow increases the risk of transportation delays?
      \end{itemize}
    \item Implications for university admissions process:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Use other information such as extracurricular activities and personal statements for university admission?
        \item Adjust weights for Center Test and the second-stage exam?
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
