  \begin{itemize}
    \item Planning to submit the paper to JEEM short 
    \item Max 3,000 words (but ``modestly longer papers will be considered'')
    \item My paper now has 3,200 words
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Weather information from Japan Meteorological Agency
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Hourly information on temperature, rainfall, snowfall, snow on the ground
        \item I use average between 6 AM to 6 PM
      \end{itemize}
    \item Matriculation for UTokyo from University Basic Information
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Information from 2012 to 2020 on the number of matriculated students for each university by prefectures at which their high schools are located
        \item I calculate the matriculation shares for UTokyo from a prefecture $j$ in year $t$ as 
          \begin{equation*}
            \frac{\text{\# matriculations for UTokyo from $j$ in year $t$}}{\text{\# total matriculations for UTokyo in year $t$}}
          \end{equation*}

      \item Notes:
        This map shows the matriculation shares (\%) for the University of Tokyo from each prefecture.
        The matriculation share is calculated based on the ratio of the number of students from high schools in the prefecture to the total number of matriculation.
        Average of the shares across years is shown in the map.
        Although not shown in the legend due to the lack of the space, the lightest color in the map means the matriculation share between 0 to 0.5\%

  \begin{equation*}
    Y_{jt} = \sum_k \alpha_k T_{jt}^k + X_{jt}' \beta + \mu_j + \tau_t + \epsilon_{jt}.
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $Y_{jt}$: matriculation share (\%) for UTokyo of a prefecture $j$ in year $t$
    \item $T_{jt}^k$: bin of average temperature across two exam dates in $j$ in year $t$
    \item $X_{jt}$: other weather variables such as rainfall, snowfall, and cumulated snow on the ground on exam dates
    \item $\mu_j$: prefecture fixed effects
    \item $\tau_t$: year fixed effects
    \item $\epsilon_{jt}$: error term
    \item Standard errors are clustered at the prefecture level
  \end{itemize}
