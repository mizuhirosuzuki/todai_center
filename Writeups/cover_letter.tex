\pIntroduction

In this paper, I examine the impact of winter cold weather on exam takers' performance in a high-stakes setting.
Although the negative effect of heat on cognitive performance in high-stakes exams has been investigated in the literature, the effect of low temperature has not been explored.
This paper examines the effect of temperature on days of a nationwide centralized test, called the National Center Test for University Admission, on exam takers' performance.
To overcome the lack of exam score data, I use the matriculation to the most prestigious university in Japan, the University of Tokyo, as an outcome.
I find that low temperature and snow cumulated on the ground reduce matriculation shares for the most prestigious university in Japan, the University of Tokyo.
